# Fabric

## Overview

[Fabric](https://get.fabric.io) provides developers with the tools they need to build the best apps. Developed and maintained by Google and the team that built Crashlytics.

For a full list of SDKs provided through Fabric visit [https://fabric.io/kits](https://fabric.io/kits).

To follow the migration to Firebase, check out the [Fabric Roadmap](https://get.fabric.io/roadmap).


## Setup

Fabric is a dependency for the Crashlytics SDK. To start using Crashlytics, there are two options:

1) The recommended way is to go to the [Firebase Crashlytics Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started?platform=ios) and follow the directions there.

2) If you aren't using Firebase yet, go to [Fabric Kits](https://fabric.io/kits), and follow the directions for Crashlytics.
