Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the iOS, macOS, tvOS & watchOS versions of Realm Swift & Realm Objective-C.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and Swift.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version, you can build Realm yourself from source.

Prerequisites:

* Building Realm requires Xcode 8.x.
* If cloning from git, submodules are required: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
* Building Realm documentation requires [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy)

Once you have all the necessary prerequisites, building Realm.framework just takes a single command: `sh build.sh build`. You'll need an internet connection the first time you build Realm to download the core binary.

Run `sh build.sh help` to see all the actions you can perform (build ios/osx, generate docs, test, etc.).
